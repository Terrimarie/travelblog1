# Travel Blog

Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Developmentâ€š Code institute

This is my travel blog website to demonstrate my frontend development skills to prospective employers, the site was created using HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4.
The travel blog site includes a simple introduction index.html page with a title, sub title, some text, button link to another page, links to other pages, navigation bar, drop down nagivation menu, homepage title link in top left corner, then an image blurb going into more detail about the travel blog and the reason for the website on idex.html and about.html. Then onto another page posts.html where the viewer can explore travel tips via embedded youtube videos and finally a contact.html page where the viewer can sign up and get in contact maybe for ask for to travel tips, advice or a collaboration.

# UX

My intention making this travel blog website is to provide a website for people who are interested in travelling and looking for inspiration for where to travel to, they may be new to travelling or already be a frequent traveller. I have designed the site to be very simple easy to use and navigate with a simplistic design and user-friendly features.
I have included links to Youtube videos, images, text and links to travel guides to provide the user with different ways of gathering travel tips and travel inspiration. 
The user is also given an opportunity to be sent more travel information and tips by using the contact page to contact the travel blogger.

User stories:
* As a user I want to discover new and interesting destinations.
* As a user I want to be recommended destinations so I can decide where to travel to next.
* As a user I want to be recommended destinations based on location.
* As a user I want to create an experience in a foreign place.
* As a user I want to browse videos to create a new travel experience.
