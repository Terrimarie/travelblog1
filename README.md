# Travel Blog

Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Developmentâ€š Code institute

This is my travel blog website to demonstrate my frontend development skills to prospective employers, the site was created using HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, Googlefonts.
The travel blog site includes 4 pages every page has a title, text, links to other pages, navigation bars on every page, drop down nagivation menu on every page, homepage title link in top left corner on every page and social media links. The index.html home page has a sub title as well as main title, a simple introduction with a youtube video, a button link to the about me page. 
The index.html home page has then an image blurb going into more detail about the travel blog and the reason for the website on index.html and about.html. About page has a home page link top left, navigation bar, main title, heading image, blurb about the site. Then onto another page posts.html again with link to home page and navigation bar where the viewer can explore travel tips via embedded youtube videos, starts with some text about the page, then youtube videos and links to travel guides. 
Finally a contact.html page where the viewer can sign up and get in contact maybe for ask for to travel tips, advice or a collaboration. Validation form added to make sure email address and name/ text is entered.

# UX

My intention making this travel blog website is to provide a website for people who are interested in travelling and looking for inspiration for where to travel to, they may be new to travelling or already be a frequent traveller. I have designed the site to be very simple easy to use and navigate with a simplistic design and user-friendly features.
I have included links to Youtube videos, images, text and links to travel guides links to provide the user with different ways of gathering travel tips and travel inspiration. 
The user is also given an opportunity to use a contact form to get more travel information and tips by using the contact page to contact the travel blogger.

User stories:
* As a user I want to discover new and interesting destinations.
* As a user I want to be recommended destinations so I can decide where to travel to next.
* As a user I want to be recommended destinations based on location.
* As a user I want to create an experience in a foreign place.
* As a user I want to browse videos and guides to create a new travel experience.
